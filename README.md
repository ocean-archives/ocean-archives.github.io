# OceanGate Titan Archive
Last update: 10:57 PT 26 June, 2023

## Background
### Why make this?
This little repository of information is put together in the interest of helping retrospective analysis of the 2023 OceanGate Titan incident. The scope of information here is intended to only extend to mechanical, logistical, and operational points of data. I will do my best to include only the information that is confirmed, and any unconfirmed or rumour-basis information will be tagged as "Unconfirmed" to the best of my ability.

## Construction
### Original Titan (aka Cyclops II)

#### Hull
* Carbon fiber wound cylinder hull built by Spencer Composites in 2017
* 6000lb, 56” diameter, 100” long
* "Alternating placement of prepreg carbon fiber/epoxy unidirectional fabrics in the axial direction, with wet winding of carbon fiber/epoxy in the hoop direction, for a total of 480 plies."
* [CompositesWorld article](https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-submersibles-under-pressure-in-deep-deep-waters)
* Carbon fiber is standard-modulus Grafil 37-800 (30K tow), supplied by Mitsubishi Chemical Carbon Fiber & Composites Inc. (Irvine, CA, US). 
* Prepreg was supplied by Irvine-based Newport Composites, now part of Mitsubishi Chemical Carbon Fiber & Composites Inc. The wet-winding epoxy is Epon Resin 682 from Hexion Inc. (Columbus, OH, US). 
* The curing agent is Lindride LS-81K frLindau Chemicals Inc.cals (Columbia, SC, US).
* Modeling was done in SolidWorks and analysis was done with COSMOS/M, supplied by Dassault Systèmes subsidiary Structural Research and Analysis Corp. [Thesis](https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/57640/ZERVOU_THESIS.pdf?sequence=1)
* The CF hull ~~may have been coated with a layer of polyurethane, though it's unknown if this is from an earlier version when Titan was still known as Cyclops II~~. [https://www.instagram.com/p/BaM6NVUFZ8z/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaM6NVUFZ8z/)
  * In a 2022 expedition video, it's claimed to be coated with Rhino Liner.
* Hull later redone due to cyclic fatigue on original Spencer Composites hull
* Hull insert
  * Designed to prevent condensation from dripping inside and isolates electronics from the hull
  * Also used for ambient lighting and aesthetic [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb0VVcRlggI/)
  * Material is unknown

#### Titanium hemispheres (x2)
* Made by Titanium Fabrication Corp
* Hatch
  * Entrance at surface depth, with hatch sealed with 17 bolts

#### Titanium rings (x2)
* Made by Titanium Fabrication Corp
* Affixed to the carbon fiber hull with a glue
* Assembly: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK99kBS1AfE)

#### Viewport
* 380-mm-diameter (21”) acrylic viewport
* ~~Manufacturer unknown, but possibly Heinz Fritz, which supplied the acrylic dome of the Cyclops I [https://www.instagram.com/p/B_08tfmHb56/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_08tfmHb56/)~~
* Fabricated by Hydrospace Group, though listed as 23" dome. Possibly indicator that two domes have been used. [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/OceanGateInc/posts/pfbid031t4h6E88fjU3NP5DLq7mZM3RG6Y7RPPnsp12kGHhacuSakTUicHzgNKtYGUckEv5l?__cft__[0]=AZXEPHTiC6StJRnuULAi0qr3uQj0MS0JeFwcdexD-o5FzEzrpXQUPDbwJK_tCJ6_ITDu_14CRsAHhAjHRNKj2m6I9qHGg6EBd1DHc-6RQNnwJny84_km24GjCT5A8wRjEZw&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R)
* Manufactured and fitted in 2017, making this viewport likely the same viewport reviewed by David Lochridge in 2018.
* In a review of the 2021 Titanic expedition, Stockton claims that the viewport is concave so a viewer could put their head inside it. This seems to conflict with pictures of the Hydrospace viewport which has a flat inner surface.
  * [Video](https://youtu.be/nIQxssTuWCw?t=810)

#### Ballast System
* Ballast control include pneumatic failsafe.
* Ballast also releases if occupants rock the ship, or, a pneumatic pump can be activated to knock the weights free.
* Lines securing the ballasts are designed to fall apart after 24 hours to automatically surface the sub.
* Variable Ballast Tanks
  * Buoyancy bag located at the top of the Titan, straddling the pressure hull. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B--ds_tls29/)

#### Fairing
* Glass fiber shell composite pieces for outer shell.
* Bolted to titanium rings.
* Empty space is filled with blocks of syntactic foam.

  * Machining done by Janicki Industries.
 
### Titan Upgrades 2023?
* Previously used systems by Sonardyne (Sonardyne Gyro Ranger 2 USBL and AvTrak 6) are removed, most likely replaced with equipment from ixBlue or Teledyne.
  * "We can confirm no Sonardyne equipment was in use or is fitted for the current mission." [Sonardyne article](https://www.sonardyne.com/case-studies/surveying-the-titanic-with-ranger-2-and-avtrak-6/)

## On-board systems at the time of the incident
### Power
* Ictineu Pressure-tolerant Li-Po Battery
  * [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgo79HIFCWn/)

### Propulsion
* Innerspace Model 1002 series electric thrusters

  * [Innerspace product page](https://innerspacethrusters.com/products/electric/model-1002-series/)

### Life Support 
* 96 hours for a crew of 5
* Equipment unknown
* CO2 Scrubber
  * Utilizes soda lime.
  * [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/OceanGateInc/videos/245982903111389)
  * "One of the many essential life support systems on a dive is a CO2 (carbon dioxide) scrubber. Our scrubbing system for Cyclops 1 and Titan contains soda lime. Soda lime are white granules that contain a mixture of calcium hydroxide (~75%) and sodium hydroxide (3%) with a precise amount of water moisture and binding agents. They absorb CO2 from the air via an exothermic, water facilitated, base catalyzed chemical reaction. The fans in our subs circulate air throughout the interior so all breathing air is consistently brought to the scrubber unit and cleaned of CO2."
* At least 4 cylinders of what appear to be oxygen (green tanks) running parallel to the hull under the floor platform. This may or may not be part of the life support system. [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdimnn-lwVl/)

### Drop weight controller
* [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWYo5FhsS2Q/)

### External component controls
* The "Birns Junction Box" (aka J-Box)
* Birns 77-pin connectors used to connect signals throughout the hull.
* [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAqPDrKJGCW/)

### Fire Safety
* Pocket Smoke Mask by HKMASK Safety Ltd.

### "Control Pod" [sic]
* Referenced in a debriefing on 2023 expedition mission 3 footage.
* Two deep sea glass instrument spheres with orange shells contain motor controllers, switches and relays. Positioned in the aft, outside of the pressure vessel hull.
* Filled with oil [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD5SUDFE6CA&t=1132s)
* Responsible for controlling the movement of the Titan.
* A spare is also kept on hand.
* The control pod units had been in use for 3 years as of the 2023 expedition.

  * [Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11119071B1/en?q=(%22stockton+rush%22)&oq=%22stockton+rush%22)

### Navigation

#### USBL
* iXBlue Posidonia USBL position system
  * [iXBlue product page](https://www.ixblue.com/store/posidonia/)
  * Posidonia uses advanced acoustic modulation, as well as digital signal processing technology and operates in the low frequency band for deep sea tracking operations. To communicate with Posidonia during each dive, Titan is equipped with iXblue’s MT8 compact low-frequency transponder.
  * Unsure whether this or the Benthos gear was used in 2023 expedition
* iXBlue MT8 compact low-frequency transponder
  * [Manual](https://www.manualslib.com/products/Ixblue-Gaps-Mt8-11014294.html)
  * Unsure whether this or the Benthos gear was used in 2023 expedition
* Teledyne Benthos USBL DAT (Directional Acoustic Transponder)
  * Probably rehoused
  * [EcoMagazine article](https://www.ecomagazine.com/news/industry/teledyne-marine-technology-utilized-extensively-onboard-oceangate-s-titan-manned-submersible)
     
#### INS
* iXBlue PHINS 6000 Inertial Navigation System (INS)
  * Phins Subsea is a subsea inertial navigation system providing position, true heading, attitude, speed, depth, and heave. Its high-accuracy inertial measurement unit is coupled with an embedded digital signal processor that runs an advanced Kalman filter. Phins Subsea can be pre-assembled and pre-calibrated with a doppler velocity log version, making the system easy to install and ready to use for more precise navigation.

#### SONAR
* Teledyne BlueView M900 Mk2 2D collision avoidance SONAR (rehoused)
  * [Product page/](http://www.teledynemarine.com/blueview/)
  * Likely with titanium housing rated to 6000m
* Teledyne BlueView BV5000 3D imaging SONAR
  *  [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=RCa3qhnF9yQ)

#### DVL
* Teledyne 6000m RDI phased array Pioneer DVL, with XRT extended tracking
  * For underwater vehicles, the bottom tracking feature can be used as an important component in the navigation systems. In this case the velocity of the vehicle is combined with an initial position fix, compass or gyro heading, and data from the acceleration sensor. The sensor suite is combined (typically by use of a Kalman filter) to estimate the position of the vehicle. This may help to navigate submarines, autonomous, and remotely operated underwater vehicles.
