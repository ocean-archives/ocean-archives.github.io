## Construction
### Original Hull (2018)
* 6000lb Carbon fiber wound cylinder hull
* Built by Spencer Composites
* alternating placement of prepreg carbon fiber/epoxy unidirectional fabrics in the axial direction, with wet winding of carbon fiber/epoxy in the hoop direction, for a total of 480 plies. [https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-submersibles-under-pressure-in-deep-deep-waters ]
* The carbon fiber is standard-modulus Grafil 37-800 (30K tow), supplied by Mitsubishi Chemical Carbon Fiber & Composites Inc. (Irvine, CA, US). 
* Prepreg was supplied by Irvine-based Newport Composites, now part of Mitsubishi Chemical Carbon Fiber & Composites Inc. The wet-winding epoxy is Epon Resin 682 from Hexion Inc. (Columbus, OH, US). 
* The curing agent is Lindride LS-81K frLindau Chemicals Inc.cals (Columbia, SC, US).
* Hull later redone due to cyclic fatigue on original Spencer Composites hull
* Modeling was done in SolidWorks and analysis was done with COSMOS/M, supplied by Dassault Syst√®mes subsidiary Structural Research and Analysis Corp.
* Two titanium hemispheres
  * Made by Titanium Fabrication Corp
* Two titanium rings
