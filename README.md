# OceanGate Titan Archive
Last update: 5:25 PM PT 24 June, 2023

## Background
### Why make this?
This little repository of information is put together in the interest of helping retrospective analysis of the 2023 OceanGate Titan incident. The scope of information here is intended to only extend to mechanical, logistical, and operational points of data. I will do my best to include only the information that is confirmed, and any unconfirmed or rumour-basis information will be tagged as "Unconfirmed" to the best of my ability.

## Construction
### Original Titan (aka Cyclops II)

#### Hull
* Carbon fiber wound cylinder hull built by Spencer Composites in 2017
* 6000lb, 56” diameter, 100” long
* "Alternating placement of prepreg carbon fiber/epoxy unidirectional fabrics in the axial direction, with wet winding of carbon fiber/epoxy in the hoop direction, for a total of 480 plies."
* [https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-submersibles-under-pressure-in-deep-deep-waters](https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-submersibles-under-pressure-in-deep-deep-waters)
* Carbon fiber is standard-modulus Grafil 37-800 (30K tow), supplied by Mitsubishi Chemical Carbon Fiber & Composites Inc. (Irvine, CA, US). 
* Prepreg was supplied by Irvine-based Newport Composites, now part of Mitsubishi Chemical Carbon Fiber & Composites Inc. The wet-winding epoxy is Epon Resin 682 from Hexion Inc. (Columbus, OH, US). 
* The curing agent is Lindride LS-81K frLindau Chemicals Inc.cals (Columbia, SC, US).
* Modeling was done in SolidWorks and analysis was done with COSMOS/M, supplied by Dassault Systèmes subsidiary Structural Research and Analysis Corp. [https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/57640/ZERVOU_THESIS.pdf?sequence=1](https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/57640/ZERVOU_THESIS.pdf?sequence=1)
* The CF hull ~~may have been coated with a layer of polyurethane, though it's unknown if this is from an earlier version when Titan was still known as Cyclops II~~. [https://www.instagram.com/p/BaM6NVUFZ8z/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaM6NVUFZ8z/)
  * In a 2022 expedition video, it's claimed to be coated with Rhino Liner.
* Hull later redone due to cyclic fatigue on original Spencer Composites hull
* Hull insert
  * Designed to prevent condensation from dripping inside and isolates electronics from the hull
  * Also used for ambient lighting and aesthetic [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb0VVcRlggI/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb0VVcRlggI/)
  * Material is unknown

#### Titanium hemispheres (x2)
* Made by Titanium Fabrication Corp
* Hatch
  * Entrance at surface depth, with hatch sealed with 17 bolts

#### Titanium rings (x2)
* Made by Titanium Fabrication Corp
* Affixed to the carbon fiber hull with a glue
* Assembly: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK99kBS1AfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK99kBS1AfE)

#### Viewport
* 380-mm-diameter (21”) acrylic viewport
* ~~Manufacturer unknown, but possibly Heinz Fritz, which supplied the acrylic dome of the Cyclops I [https://www.instagram.com/p/B_08tfmHb56/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_08tfmHb56/)~~
* Fabricated by Hydrospace Group, though listed as 23" dome. Possibly indicator that two domes have been used.

* Manufactured and fitted in 2017, making this viewport likely the same viewport reviewed by David Lochridge in 2018.

#### Ballast System
* Ballast control include pneumatic failsafe.
* Ballast also releases if occupants rock the ship, or, a pneumatic pump can be activated to knock the weights free.
* Lines securing the ballasts are designed to fall apart after 24 hours to automatically surface the sub.
* Variable Ballast Tanks
  * Buoyancy bag located at the top of the Titan, straddling the pressure hull. [https://www.instagram.com/p/B--ds_tls29/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B--ds_tls29/)

#### Fairing

### Navigation

#### USBL
* Posidonia USBL position system
  * [https://www.ixblue.com/store/posidonia/](https://www.ixblue.com/store/posidonia/)
  * Posidonia uses advanced acoustic modulation, as well as digital signal processing technology and operates in the low frequency band for deep sea tracking operations. To communicate with Posidonia during each dive, Titan is equipped with iXblue’s MT8 compact low-frequency transponder.
  * Unsure whether this or the Benthos gear was used in 2023 expedition
* Teledyne Benthos USBL DAT (Directional Acoustic Transponder)
  * Probably rehoused

#### INS
* iXBlue PHINS 6000 Inertial Navigation System (INS)
  * Phins Subsea is a subsea inertial navigation system providing position, true heading, attitude, speed, depth, and heave. Its high-accuracy inertial measurement unit is coupled with an embedded digital signal processor that runs an advanced Kalman filter. Phins Subsea can be pre-assembled and pre-calibrated with a doppler velocity log version, making the system easy to install and ready to use for more precise navigation.
* iXBlue MT8 compact low-frequency transponder

#### SONAR
* Teledyne BlueView M900 Mk2 2D collision avoidance SONAR (rehoused)
  * [http://www.teledynemarine.com/blueview/](http://www.teledynemarine.com/blueview/)
  * Likely with titanium housing rated to 6000m
* Teledyne BlueView BV5000 3D imaging SONAR
  *  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=RCa3qhnF9yQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=RCa3qhnF9yQ)

#### DVL
* Teledyne 6000m RDI phased array Pioneer DVL, with XRT extended tracking
  * For underwater vehicles, the bottom tracking feature can be used as an important component in the navigation systems. In this case the velocity of the vehicle is combined with an initial position fix, compass or gyro heading, and data from the acceleration sensor. The sensor suite is combined (typically by use of a Kalman filter) to estimate the position of the vehicle. This may help to navigate submarines, autonomous, and remotely operated underwater vehicles.
